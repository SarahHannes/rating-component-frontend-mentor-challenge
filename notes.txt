- separate html for each of the pages?
    - have submit button link to the thank you page using method='post' after user click the submit button
        - js: addeventlistener on submit button --> load the other page

- same html for both page
    - on submit, hide the other div
    - use grid area
    - on submit, toggle hidden class

- another idea = use js to show --> innerhtml on submit
